# Tempo

Tempo is a personal health data mining project. I'm trying to determine from the metrics I have how hard to push myself, and whether or not running is providing actual longevity.

To start your Phoenix server:

* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4003`](http://localhost:4003) from your browser.

You'll also need to run the [iPhone client](https://github.com/raulnor/tempo-ios) to upload your own data.
